# Is Upwork Payment Protection REAL or FAKE?

On November 10, 2024, I was **scammed out of $1,800** by a client who was extremely difficult to identify as a scammer. The client fulfilled all the requirements suggested by Upwork for freelancers to check before starting a contract, so I assumed that Upwork would handle everything else. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

Even last year, in December 2023, I was scammed out of $1,400. However, since I hadn’t fulfilled all the payment protection terms at that time, I didn’t claim payment protection. That experience, though painful, became a valuable lesson for me as a freelancer. From that point forward, I have always made sure to fulfill all the terms and conditions of Upwork’s payment protection.

## My efreelance xperience in Upwork.

I have been working as a Full-Stack Developer on Upwork for over three years, delivering enterprise-level applications. When I first started, all I cared about was finding a job. However, over time, it has become increasingly challenging to secure legitimate work. The unfortunate reality is that not all jobs on Upwork are legitimate, and in 2024, the platform has become a target for scammers. While Upwork is trying its best to make the platform safe, to be honest, it hasn’t fully succeeded.
