# Is Upwork Payment Protection REAL or FAKE?

On November 10, 2024, I was **scammed out of $1,800** by a client who was extremely difficult to identify as a scammer. The client fulfilled all the requirements suggested by Upwork for freelancers to check before starting a contract, so I assumed that Upwork would handle everything else. Unfortunately, I was wrong. In Upwork there a **Hourly contract Payment Protection** if you meet all the terms of the payment protection. But, either it is real protection or is not is questioning, becuase it rejected to protect my contract even if I meet all the conditions.

Even last year, in December 2023, I was scammed out of $1,400. However, since I hadnâ€™t fulfilled all the payment protection terms at that time, I didnâ€™t claim payment protection. That experience, though painful, became a valuable lesson for me as a freelancer. From that point forward, I have always made sure to fulfill all the terms and conditions of Upworkâ€™s payment protection.

## The Question: Is Upwork Hourly Payment Protection Real or Fake?

In this post, I will share my three years of experience as a freelancer on Upwork and discuss the following topics:

- My efreelance xperience in Upwork.
- What you should consider before starting work as a freelancer.
- How you can spot scammers.
- Who should you trust: Upwork or your client?
- The legitimacy of Upworkâ€™s payment protection.
- Personal advice from my three years of experience.

**If youâ€™re considering working on Upwork or are already a freelancer there, you need to read and stick with this post until the end to protect yourself as a freelancer.**

## My efreelance xperience in Upwork.

I have been working as a Full-Stack Developer on Upwork for over three years, delivering enterprise-level applications. When I first started, all I cared about was finding a job. However, over time, it has become increasingly challenging to secure legitimate work. The unfortunate reality is that not all jobs on Upwork are legitimate, and in 2024, the platform has become a target for scammers. While Upwork is trying its best to make the platform safe, to be honest, it hasnâ€™t fully succeeded.

## The recent job that makes me lose $1800

On **Oct 24, 2024; **I received a notification of Job invitation from Upwork. Then I accept the invitation and applied for the job, because it was a good mutch for experiance. The client appricieted my application and the conversation gose well and the client agreed to give the contract offer.

But, Before I accept the offer I had to check the legitimacy of the client. According to the Upwork recommendation to check the legitimacy of a client, I do not found any client suspecsious thing.

- Client **payment method verified** by Upwork itself.
- Client **Phone number verified** by Upwork itself.

And the client shared his **GitHub**, **Figma design**, and **Trello** task management, makes me trust the contract, because look a real business looks. Then, I accepted the offer, the client told me I had to on **Monday, Oct 28** while he offered me the contract on "Thursday, Oct 25". In short It was realy hard to spot the client as a fradulent, he even fooled Upwork itself.

As the project started, I was really working hard, pushing my updates to GitHub daily, update tasks status on trello, and aslo update him on the Upwork messaging. The client was very happy on the progressand t he first week was done with a huge appriciation.

![Image of the client expressed his feedback on the progress](https://res.cloudinary.com/dshwnppvx/image/upload/v1732735650/portfolio/assests/upwork/Upwork-00_glthgu.png)

Second week started, the contract and the communication continued very well. But the game strted on Friday monrning, Nov 08, 2024. I received a message that says, "**We paused the contract because we are investigating an issue with the client payment method.**".

![Image of the contract pausing message from upwork](https://res.cloudinary.com/dshwnppvx/image/upload/v1732735650/portfolio/assests/upwork/Upwork-00_glthgu.png)

I started to contact the client, but unfortunatly the client disappeared forever. Then I had to wait for the upwork response.

Aftter a week, I received a **Reversal Notification: Upwork Hourly Protection** email tell Upwork restricted the client account and my $1000 is refunded back to the client becuase of I didn't me the criteria for the Hourly Payment Protection. Hmmm, Really! But this was not true. I know I meet all the requirments, becuase I learned from my last year experiance.

![Image of the contract pausing message from upwork](../../../assests/upwork-payment-protection/hourly-payment-rejection-first-email.png)

Well! what are the criteria then? Ok, Here you go, I have replied with the following email.

![Image of the contract pausing message from upwork](../../../assests/upwork-payment-protection/hourly-payment-rejection-first-email-replay.png)

Look on the follwoing shcreenshots proof, I do meet all of the criteria

![Screeshots proof](../../../assests/upwork-payment-protection/criterias-meet-proof.png)

If you see in the first Upwork email regarding the payment protection rejection, Upwork can't cover the payment due to I do not meet the criteria for the payment protection, but after I provided the all the requirments proof which shows that I meet all of them, Upwork changed the reason of my payment protection, and replayed with this "**Reviewing your work diary and contract showed Terms of Use Violation, as your contract with the client is fraudulent. Because of this and the fact that the charges remain unpaid by the client, you are not eligible for payment protection under the Terms of Service.**" ðŸ¤”Confusing enough, right! So two questions here:

1. How I expected to identify a client who do not show any fraudulent sign, and was approved by Upwork itself?
2. What is the Upwork payment protection for if it does not pay on situations like this?

Here is the second email shcreenshot.

## Reasons Upwork is easy for scammers

- In hourly payment protect, upwork do not screw client money, so the scammers can west the freelancer time until they get a payment prompt from Upwork wich is after 2 weeks. If cleint intention is to scam, they can scam at least two weeks of freelancer salary because of the Upwork payment vulnerabilty.
