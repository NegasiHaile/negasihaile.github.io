            You’re in the home stretch of your release cycle. It’s time to ship
            your product...and you have to write release notes.
            <br />
            <br />
            By the time many SaaS product teams reach the end of a release
            cycle, they treat the release notes as an afterthought. They rush to

            that particular development cycle.

            They’re an opportunity to keep your customers excited about their
            investment in your product. They can drive adoption of new features
            and functionality, reduce concerns about bugs or known issues, and
            even be a powerful marketing tool.

            In this article, we’ll look at what release notes are, who should
            write them, and how you and your users benefit from good release
            notes. And don’t worry, we’ll be diving into real examples and a
            template you can steal for your own release notes.
